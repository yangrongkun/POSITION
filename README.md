### Abstract

3D scene CAD recomposition aims to reconstruct a given scene with
CAD models retrieved from a database to simulate the original geometry and arrangement. 
While recent methods produce satisfactory results on closed-set databases with limited types 
of objects, they cannot be applied in the real world with diverse objects that are unseen in 
the training set. In this paper, we propose POSITION, an open-world 3D scene CAD recomposition 
method to reconstruct the 3D scene with CADs retrieved from an open-set database. 
Our POSITION consists of three steps: Firstly, we extract open-world multi-modal object representations from a captured 3D scene. Secondly, on top of the extracted representations, we propose a training-free multi-modal coarse-to-fine retrieval method to retrieve CADs that visually, geometrically and semantically match the objects. Thirdly, we present a physical plausible pose alignment method to adjust retrieved CAD models to maintain consistent geometry and layout with the observation. Extensive experiments on the Replica and ScanNet datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed POSITION.
